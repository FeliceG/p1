<h2>In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</h2>
    <p>I am working towards a second or is it third career, hopefully in web development. I love creating interactive websites that make work processes more efficient and accurate. Much of my daytime work involves event management--keeping track of details, collecting slide sets, managing many details that are best collected and stored by a content management system.<br /> <br />
    I currently work at McLean Hospital as an event coordinator. I developed a couple of websites to provide and collect information from the speakers and poster/paper applicants. While the websites were very helpful to do my job, the websites could have been designed better. The websites were built in Joomla with extensions incorporated to help collect data. I had a difficult time viewing the information with the extension. I want to have more control over what the website can do and have a better understanding of the backend.</p>

<h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
I want to learn Laravel, continue to develop my programming and web development skills, and hopefully use these new skills to find a job doing web development.

<h2>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h2>
<p>I am working on a Mac using Text Wrangler as a code editor.</p>

<h2>Anything else we should know?</h2>
<p>Good question. When I did the prerequisite quiz, I did not read the question carefully to see that I could select more than one answer. If I had, I would have selected the two paramaters passed into the function found on the first line! Drat! Also, I would love to hear others experiences finding web development work without having the prerequisite 3+ years development experience I find on most job postings.</p>
